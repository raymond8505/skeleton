So I can hit the ground running on new projects

# Client

1. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) React with Typescript
2. [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for styles
3. [Ant](https://ant.design/components/overview) for icons and components
4. [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for store

## Instructions

# App Server

Node with Web Socket connection to client. This is primarily for personal projects running at home, so server does not authenticate!

# DB Server

[Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/)

grab the executable for your OS and put it in the db dir
